// Bagels
// Generate a secret number and assign the digits to secret1, secret2, secret3
//         These will stay for the rest of the game

// Request input of a three digit number, assign its digits to digit1, digit2, digit3
//         These only stay for this one guess
//         There are only 20 guesses allowed
// Declare variables for the numbers of Picos and number of Fermis
// Compare digit1 to secret1, compare digit2 to secret2, compare digit3 to secret3
//         For each match, there is a Fermi for this guess
//         If there are three Fermis, the guess is correct
// Compare digit1 to secret2 or secret3, compare digit2 to secret1 or secret3,
// compare digit3 to secret1 or secret2
//         For each match, there is a Pico for this guess
// If there are no Picos or Fermis, print Bagels
// Print number of Picos, print number of Fermis

// press any key and then release, the program counts how many while loops it takes to
// release, that is the seed for a pseudorandom algorithm

// while loop for guess

// for now we hardcode the secret number, need the weekend to do the random assignment
